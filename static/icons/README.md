# PWA Icons

Place PWA icons here:
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

You can generate these icons using any image editor or online tool. The icons should represent the app (e.g., a dumbbell or workout-related icon).

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they're required for a complete PWA experience.

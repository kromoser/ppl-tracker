# Customized Upper Body & Core Push/Pull Workout Routine

## Program Overview

This **16-week progressive program** is designed specifically for your goals: building lean muscle definition, increasing upper body and core strength, and achieving a fit beach physique by summer. The routine minimizes leg work while strategically incorporating glute activation for muscles underutilized during running.

The program operates on a **4-day weekly split** with two push days and two pull days, leaving adequate recovery time for your running schedule. Each session is structured to fit within your weekday 45-minute window and can be extended on weekends for additional volume or conditioning.

## Day 1: Push Day (Upper Body Emphasis)

**Duration:** 35-40 minutes  
**Focus:** Chest, shoulders, triceps

| Exercise | Machine Option | Dumbbell Option | Sets | Reps | Rest |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dumbbell Bench Press** | Chest Press Machine | Dumbbell Bench Press | 4 | 8-10 | 90 sec |
| **Incline Dumbbell Press** | Incline Chest Machine | Incline Dumbbell Press | 3 | 10-12 | 75 sec |
| **Overhead Shoulder Press** | Shoulder Press Machine | Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 3 | 8-10 | 90 sec |
| **Lateral Raises** | Lateral Raise Machine | Dumbbell Lateral Raises | 3 | 12-15 | 60 sec |
| **Tricep Dips** | Tricep Dip Machine | Bench Dips (bodyweight) | 3 | 8-12 | 75 sec |
| **Overhead Tricep Extension** | Cable Extension Machine | Single Dumbbell Overhead Extension | 2 | 10-12 | 60 sec |

**Notes:** Start with weights that allow you to complete reps 1-3 with moderate difficulty but reps 8-10 with high effort. Compound movements (bench and shoulder press) come first when energy is highest.

## Day 2: Pull Day (Back & Biceps)

**Duration:** 35-40 minutes  
**Focus:** Lats, back, biceps

| Exercise | Machine Option | Dumbbell Option | Sets | Reps | Rest |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lat Pulldown** | Lat Pulldown Machine | Single Arm Dumbbell Rows | 4 | 8-10 | 90 sec |
| **Bent-Over Dumbbell Row** | Seated Row Machine | Bent-Over Dumbbell Rows | 3 | 8-10 | 90 sec |
| **Bicep Curls** | Cable Bicep Curl | Dumbbell Bicep Curls | 3 | 10-12 | 75 sec |

| **Face Pulls** | Cable Face Pull Machine | Resistance Band Face Pulls | 2 | 12-15 | 60 sec |
| **Reverse Flyes** | Pec Deck (Reverse) | Dumbbell Reverse Flyes | 2 | 12-15 | 60 sec |

**Notes:** Rowing movements emphasize back thickness while bicep curls build arm definition. Incline curls target the long head of the biceps for peak definition. Face pulls and reverse flyes help posture and shoulder health.

## Day 3: Push Day + Core

**Duration:** 40-45 minutes  
**Focus:** Upper chest/shoulders, triceps, core

| Exercise | Machine Option | Dumbbell Option | Sets | Reps | Rest |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Incline Bench Press** | Incline Press Machine | Incline Dumbbell Press | 4 | 8-10 | 90 sec |
| **Dumbbell Shoulder Press** | Shoulder Press Machine | Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 3 | 8-10 | 90 sec |

| **Dead Bug** | N/A (Bodyweight) | Bodyweight Dead Bug | 2 | 12/side | 45 sec |

**Notes:** This day targets the upper chest from a different angle and provides substantial core work. The Pallof press is excellent for anti-rotation core strength and oblique definition. Reduce tricep volume slightly since you worked it on Day 1.

## Day 4: Pull + Lower Body (Glute Focused)

**Duration:** 40-45 minutes  
**Focus:** Back, biceps, glute activation

| Exercise | Machine Option | Dumbbell Option | Sets | Reps | Rest |

| **Hammer Curls** | Cable Hammer Curl | Dumbbell Hammer Curls | 3 | 10-12 | 75 sec |
| **Cable Curls** | Cable Bicep Machine | Single Arm Dumbbell Curls | 2 | 12-15 | 60 sec |
| **Single-Leg Glute Bridge** | Glute Bridge Machine | Bodyweight Single-Leg Glute Bridge | 3 | 10-12/leg | 60 sec |
| **Donkey Kicks** | Glute Kickback Machine | Bodyweight Donkey Kicks | 3 | 15/leg | 45 sec |
| **Side Plank Hip Lifts** | Core Machine | Bodyweight Side Plank Hip Lifts | 2 | 10-15/side | 60 sec |

## Progressive Overload & Progression Structure

Your strength will progress differently during the 16-week block. Follow this approach:

### Weeks 1-4: Technique Foundation
- Focus on perfect form and mind-muscle connection
- Choose weights where the last 2-3 reps feel challenging
- Target weight increases: +2.5-5 lbs every 2-3 sessions on main lifts (bench, rows, shoulder press)

### Weeks 5-8: Volume Building
- Increase reps or sets rather than always chasing heavier weight
- Example: If you hit 4Ã—10 at 35 lbs, next session try 4Ã—12
- Once you hit target reps at a weight, increase weight by 5 lbs and drop back to lower rep range

### Weeks 9-12: Strength Focus
- Lower reps slightly (6-8 range) on main compounds to chase heavier weight
- Maintain higher reps on isolation lifts (10-15 range)
- Add 2.5-5 lbs weekly on main lifts

### Weeks 13-16: Peaking & Definition
- Focus on moderate weight (10-12 reps) with perfect form
- Emphasize the squeeze at the top of each rep for definition
- Drop sets on final sets of isolation exercises for metabolic fatigue

## Nutrition & Recovery Tips

**Protein Intake:** Aim for 0.8-1 gram per pound of bodyweight (130-160g daily for you) to support muscle growth while maintaining lean body composition.

**Caloric Balance:** To maintain leanness while building muscle, eat at maintenance calories or a slight deficit (200-300 calories below maintenance). Since you run 25 miles weekly, your caloric expenditure is already high.

**Training Frequency:** Your 4-day lifting split combined with 4-6 running days works well because you're distributing volume across the week and leveraging your running for conditioning without interfering with strength training recovery.

**Sleep & Recovery:** Aim for 7-9 hours nightly; strength gains and muscle definition occur during sleep. Post-run, perform glute activation (donkey kicks, glute bridges) to reinforce proper motor patterns.

---

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Establish baseline strength. Perform all exercises at 3 sets to learn form. Track all weights used.

**Week 3-4:** Increase volume to full sets listed. Begin tracking exercises in a spreadsheet or app. Adjust weight if you're finishing sets feeling too easy or can't complete final reps with control.

**Week 5+:** Add weight every 2-3 sessions on main compounds. If you hit prescribed reps with 2+ reps to spare, increase weight next session.

This program is designed to be sustainable alongside your running schedule while delivering visible, meaningful strength and definition gains by summer. The key is consistencyâ€”hitting these sessions weekly and progressively increasing weight while maintaining perfect form.
